## Active subsystem roadmaps

| Subsystem | Status | Next handoff | Blockers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standalone general decision-model framework | M013/M013a conditionally closed; **M013b closed** | Integration PR for the M013/M013a/M013b stack; a newly scoped prospective experiment only after a separately frozen preregistration | Source remains unmerged into main; crates.io publication remains a separate human/legal gate |
| CodeGG consumer-specific effectiveness (M005) | deferred / indeterminate | independent CodeGG-owned evidence, unscheduled | No approved corpus; does not block M008-M011 |

## Interface and operational dependencies

CodeGG historically pins SDM commit 8139b064bdcf3212e8f6fd912e801a479b55751c per the recorded interface dependency; verify the live CodeGG pin before changing it. Do not retarget CodeGG until a separate consumer-side plan and exact SHA compatibility qualification. Existing 12/11 fixtures measure shape/identity, not model usefulness. M005 is indeterminate and does not authorize live tool promotion. M006 and M007 generic infrastructure and qualification work are complete as recorded in their closure files. A new approved independent CodeGG corpus and consumer-owned adapter remain external gates for CodeGG effectiveness claims.

## Standalone successor handoff

Accepted boundary: plans/adrs/ADR-0002-standalone-framework-before-consumer-qualification.md. M008-M011 are closed in plans/closure/general-decision-model-framework/. All four are SDM-only and independent of the unavailable CodeGG corpus; no change to CodeGG's immutable SDM pin or production policy is authorized. M011 provides a reviewable release candidate, not automatic merge, publication or deployment. **M012 remains conditionally closed** for release/publication qualification, but its source PR #1 is now merged into main. Crates.io publication is blocked pending human/legal license review. **M013 and M013a are conditionally closed**; see their closure records for the invalid M013 suite and M013a's valid negative/indeterminate evidence. These milestones do not rewrite M011's positive, negative, or indeterminate model evidence. M005 continues to await an approved independent CodeGG corpus and consumer-owned evidence.

## M013b corrective handoff

Plan: plans/implementation/general-decision-model-framework/013b-evaluation-gates-and-failure-diagnostics.md. Planning branch: work/plans-sdm-m013b-quality-gates-diagnostics; source predecessor work/plans-sdm-m013-predictive-quality-corrective@694da1a002cf29c62724be6ba881240f43aac9c2. Scope: corrected fixed-option counterfactual responsiveness, executable mandatory positive-quality gates, a source-backed M013a erratum sidecar, and train/dev-only Binary and Choice diagnostics. M013b corrected evaluation integrity and isolated both root causes; it did NOT qualify any candidate. Closure evidence: plans/closure/general-decision-model-framework/013b-status.md. No new qualifying held-out experiment is authorized. Source integration remains unmerged and requires a separately reviewed PR.

## Future-plan readiness after M013b

M013b is closed (hosted CI green on run [38107604379](https://github.com/dbowm91/sdm/actions/runs/38107604379)), so a successor may now be **registered**, but not started as qualified work. M013b diagnostics isolated two testable mechanisms — a constant-feature hidden bias in Binary and a truth-independent interaction offset in Choice — and `scripts/validate_future_support.py` exists so any future protocol can verify eligible-subgroup support *before* final inference. A successor plan must prospectively seal its data, protocol and numeric thresholds, pass that validator, and use NEW independent frozen test groups. No M013a test row is qualification-eligible, no CodeGG model promotion is authorized, and crates.io publication stays behind its human/legal gate.

## M013 quality-corrective handoff controls

M013 implementation and original corpus freeze are at `c56f442fae14ede38fd1cd6e0eccf61315df96da`; closure evidence is `plans/closure/general-decision-model-framework/013-status.md`. Preserve its reports only as invalid diagnostics. M013a froze new data and protocol at `4768716d97cc58ea338d8099bfe09a1e57d0d8f9` before one-time held-out inference; see `plans/closure/general-decision-model-framework/013a-status.md` for exact evidence. No M013 or M013a result promotes a model or lifts the crates.io legal gate.

## M012 release-reconciliation handoff controls

Planning baseline: work/plans-sdm-standalone-framework-m008-m011@f9ce89765a1cb07ce23100177d8f56c30e52777d; main@8139b064bdcf3212e8f6fd912e801a479b55751c at planning, revalidate before implementing. Source planning branch: work/plans-sdm-m012-release-reconciliation. A newly reviewed main-targeted PR, not a direct main push, is the expected integration handoff. Do not merge, tag, publish any crate or retarget CodeGG as part of planning. Closure belongs at plans/closure/general-decision-model-framework/012-status.md with verified evidence and separately recorded merge/publication decisions.

Historical M012 planning text above describes its original pre-merge handoff; live PR #1 is merged as recorded in the active status.
