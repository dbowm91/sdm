# Small Decision Model (SDM)

SDM is the independent home for generic bounded decision semantics, local artifact
inference, and reproducible training/evaluation. CodeGG-specific authority, tool
projection, disclosure, capture consent, and causal-frontier behavior stay in CodeGG.

## Repository policy

- License: MIT, preserving the Anomalyco copyright notice from the CodeGG source.
- Initial visibility: private.
- Consumption/release policy: downstream projects pin an immutable full Git commit
  SHA. Branch names and floating tags are not runtime dependencies. A source revision
  is usable only after CI and the CodeGG compatibility fixture command pass.
- This repository performs no implicit network access or model download.

## Workspace

- `sdm-core`: semantic request/response types and validation, no application authority.
- `sdm-runtime`: validated offline artifact loading and bounded inference. It has no
  dependency on `sdm-training`.
- `sdm-training`: generic decision-case dataset validation, deterministic group
  splitting, model fitting, dev-only threshold selection, and test evaluation.

Initial runtime architecture is a sparse binary relevance model applied independently
to Rank candidates. The semantic core supports Binary, Choice, Score, and Rank; the
first trainer/runtime artifact supports Rank and returns explicit Unsupported for the
other semantics. Multiple relevant Rank candidates remain independent labels.

## Build and qualify

```sh
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo check -p sdm-runtime --locked
cargo tree -p sdm-runtime --locked
cargo run -p sdm-training --bin sdm-check-compat -- \
  fixtures/codegg-compatibility-v1.jsonl path/to/artifact.json
cargo run -p sdm-training --bin sdm-train -- \
  fixtures/compatibility-rank-cases-v1.jsonl artifacts/compatibility-rank-v1.json 127 100
```

The compatibility fixture file is a sanitized, frozen copy of CodeGG's
`assets/decision-runtime/compatibility-v1.jsonl` at source revision
`aec30ebbaada172cd2915b3fb068f828a8fc6709`. The authoritative fixtures and historical
training/qualification evidence remain in CodeGG. No user session data was copied.
`scripts/import-codegg-compat-fixtures.py` regenerates the small Rank training set from
only the frozen source fixtures. `artifacts/compatibility-rank-v1.json` is a reproducible
baseline artifact, not a qualified or production-promoted model.

## Provenance

The semantic core originated in CodeGG commit
`aec30ebbaada172cd2915b3fb068f828a8fc6709`, file
`crates/codegg-core/src/decision.rs`. It is carried with its MIT license and source
attribution. The runtime and generic trainer in this repository are new implementations
that preserve the published semantic contract; they do not claim experiment-result or
model-weight provenance from CodeGG.
